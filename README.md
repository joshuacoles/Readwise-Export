# Obsidian Readwise Utility

A version of the [Obsidian Readwise mirror plugin](https://github.com/jsonMartin/readwise-mirror) which runs
locally on the command line and makes a couple different choices for how notes are assembled. The obsidian plugin
is likely substantially more useful to the average user and should be used instead of this.

Mainly a playground for a more general framework of X -> Obsidian conversion utilities.

See the help message for documentation if you want to use this.
